=head1 NAME

nat-css - Corpus Search Sentence utility.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  nat-css [-q <rank>] <lex1> <crp1> <lex2> <crp2> [<sent_nr> | all]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nat-css> is used after the alignment process (using, for example,
C<nat-these> tool).  Its objective is to search sentences where one
word occurs.

The tool has two methods of use:

  nat-css [-q <rank>] <lex1> <crp1> <lex2> <crp2>

where the tool opens the two lexicon files and the two corpora files
in interactive mode. The user writes a word or a word sequence and the
tool finds its occurrences on the corpus, printing the sentence from
C<crp1> where it occurs, and aligned sentence from C<crp2>. If the
C<rank> is provided, the tool prints the ranking or quality of the
alignment, too.

The other method of operation is:

 nat-css [-q <rank>] <lex1> <crp1> <lex2> <crp2> (<sent_nr> | all)

where the tool prints the pair of sentences number C<sent_nr> or all
the sentences (if the C<all> option is used). Again, if C<rank> is
used, the tool prints the ranking or quality of the alignment.
