=head1 NAME

nat-postbin - A translator from dictionary file to the Perl readable format.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nat-postbin <matdic-in> <lex1> <lex2> <out-dic1> <out-dic2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is not intended to be used independently.

C<nat-postbub> reads the dictionary created with C<nat-mat2dic> and
lexicon files created by the C<nat-pre> tool, to write two dictionary
files on a very small binary format.

The internal format can change a lot, so please use NATools to manage
these files.

The format is a gzipped binary file. First 32 bits unsigned integer is
the number of entries in the dictionary. Follows a sequence of
MAXENTRY size, with pairs of translation identifier (32 bits unsigned
integer) and probability (32 bits float).
