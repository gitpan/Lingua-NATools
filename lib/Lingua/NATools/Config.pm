=head1 NAME

Lingua::NATools::Config - Simple configuration file API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use NAT::Config;

  my $config = Lingua::NATools::Config->new("config.cnf");
  my $val = $config->param("key");
  $config->param("key", ++$val);
  $config->write;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 C<new>

The NAT::Config object constructor receives the name of the file to be
processed. It returns an NAT::Config object ready to be queried.

    my $cnf = Lingua::NATools::Config("/path/to/the/configuration/file")->new;

You can also create a configuration object from scratch:

    my $cnf = Lingua::NATools::Config->new;

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = {};
    local $/ = "\n";

    if ($_[0]) {
        my $file = shift;
        $self->{' filename '} = $file;

        open I, "$file" or die "Can't open file '$file'\n";
        while(<I>) {
            chomp;
            next if m!^\s*$!;
            next if m!^\s*#!;
            next if m!^\[!;
            my ($l,$r) = m!^([^=]+?)\s*=\s*(.*?)\s*$!;
            $self->{$l} = $r;
        }
        close I;
    }

    return bless $self => $class # amen
}

=head2 C<param>

This is the accessor method for any configuration parameter. Pass it
just one argument and you'll get that parameter value. Pass a second
argument and you are setting the parameter value.

   # get value for key "foo"
   $val = $cnf->param("foo");

   # set value "bar" for key "foo"
   $cnf->param("foo", "bar");

=cut

sub param {
    my $self  = shift;
    my $param = shift;

    my $val;
    if (defined($_[0])) {
        $val = shift;
        $self->{$param} = $val;
    } else {
        $val = exists($self->{$param})?$self->{$param}:undef;
    }
    return $val;
}

=head2 C<write>

This is the method used to write down the configuration object to a
file. If you have opened a configuration file with C<new>, then you
can just "save it":

   $cnf->write;

If you created a configuration object from scratch, you need to supply
a filename:

   $cnf->write("file.cnf");

You can always force a filename.

=cut

sub write {
    my $self     = shift;
    my $filename = shift;
    $filename = $self->{' filename '} if !$filename && exists $self->{' filename '};

    die "No filename supplied\n" unless $filename;

    open O, ">", $filename or die "Can't open file '$filename' for writing\n";
    print O "[nat]\n";
    for (keys %$self) {
        print O "$_=$self->{$_}\n";
    }
    close O;
}
